NOTE: Currently highly under development.

Asciidocular is a small AngularJS web app that loads http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] files via Ajax and renders them as a full web site. Asciidocular uses https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js] to convert the AsciiDoc files into HTML.

Asciidocular can be used to create a documentation site of your project or API. For example, you could use Asciidocular together with https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup] to create a documentation site of your http://swagger.io[Swagger] API.

Since AsciiDoc syntax is just plain text, you can write an AsciiDoc document using any text editor.

Advantages:

* No build process and server-side tools needed to convert your AsciiDoc files into HTML
* Responsive Bootswatch (Bootstrap) theme
* Deployable via GitHub Pages
* Just create AsciiDoc files and deploy!

Features:

* Supports highlight.js
* Supports Font-Awesome
