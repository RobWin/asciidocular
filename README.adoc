NOTE: It is currently under development.

Asciidocular is a small AngularJS web app that loads http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] files via Ajax and renders them as a full page.
Asciidocular uses https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js] to convert the AsciiDoc files into HTML.

Asciidocular can be used to create a documentation site of your project or API. For example, you could use Asciidocular together with https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup] to
create a documentation site of your Swagger API.

Advantages:
* No server-side components needed to convert your AsciiDoc files into HTML
* No build process and tools needed
* Deployable via GitHub Pages
* Responsive Bootswatch Slate (Bootstrap) theme
* Just create a Asciidoctor files and deploy!

== Example

You have to create an `index.adoc` file in the `docs` folder of the app. You can include other AsciiDoc files into the
`index.adoc` file.
