NOTE: Currently highly under development.

Asciidocular is a small AngularJS web app that loads http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] files via Ajax and renders them as a full web site.
Asciidocular uses https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js] to convert the AsciiDoc files into HTML.

Asciidocular can be used to create a documentation site of your project or API. For example, you could use Asciidocular together with https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup] to
create a documentation site of your http://swagger.io[Swagger] API.

Advantages:

* No server-side components needed to convert your AsciiDoc files into HTML
* No build process and tools needed
* Deployable via GitHub Pages
* Responsive Bootswatch Slate (Bootstrap) theme
* Just create a Asciidoctor files and deploy!

== Usage Guide

You have to create an `index.adoc` file in the `docs` folder of the app. You can include other AsciiDoc files into the
`index.adoc` file.

* The document title is the title of the web site.
* The preamble of the document is the content of the jumbotron.
* Each level 1 section title is a top-level navigation item and each level 2 section title is a sub navigation item of the parent section in the navigation bar.
